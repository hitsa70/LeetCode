Simple intution

Sort array
starting 2 elements are smallest
ending 2 are largest
calculate and return

class Solution {
    public int maxProductDifference(int[] nums) {
        
        int length=nums.length;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return (nums[length-1]*nums[length-2])-(nums[0]*nums[1]);
    }
}

Can be optimized by 4 pointer and linear traversal

firstBiggest
secondBiggest
firstSmallest
secondSmallest
and TC will be O( N ) , space O( 1 )
